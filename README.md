In the early 1500’s, the economic world was ruled by a school of thought named “The Mercantilist”. This group viewed gold as the most desirable form of wealth. Mercantilists tended to equate the wealth of a nation to the amount of gold and silver bullion it possessed. Trading of gold amongst nations flourished during this period. This was encouraged by the duty-free import on raw materials imposed by countries which followed the tenets of the Mercantilists. 

Gold prices have been on the rise over the couple of decades. Countries which are lucky to be mining this rare commodity has seen an increase in the price in which they trade their gold.  This is due to the increased demand on this rare material. 

We have herein done some exploration on the monthly gold prices from January 1979 to 2021. Data exploration on structured data sets can be done on Python, Excel, SQL amongst others subject to preference and limitations. For the purposes of this data set, I have chosen to do exploration in SQL and visualized some of the results in Power Bi 
The following Indicators are which we focused on. 
•	Count (Estimates the number of times a country traded gold during this period)

•	Average (The average/mean is the SUM of all gold prices of a distinct country divided by its COUNT. This is used as a measure of dispersion.)

•	Standard Deviation (This reflects how much gold prices are dispersed relative to the mean gold price. In essence, this measures the average amount of variability in our data set) 


•	Minimum (This estimates the minimum price each country has traded their gold during this period)  

•	Lower(q1), Median(q2), Upper quartiles(q3) (q1 represents the value that indicates the end of the first 25% of the data values; q2 represents the value that indicates the end of the second 25% (or the value which divides the data set into two equal parts, that is the median); and q3 is the value indicating the end of the third 25%. The middle 50% of the data lies between q1 and q3. 


•	Maximum (This estimates the maximum price each country has traded their gold during this period)
